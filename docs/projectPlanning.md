I want to build an application that...

- The goal of this project is to develop a personalized trading assistant web application that helps users identify the trading styles and optimal trading times that naturally align with their daily routines and behavioral tendencies. By combining inputs such as schedule availability and personality insights, the application provides tailored suggestions to support a more personalized, informed, and sustainable trading experience. Ultimately, the platform aims to enhance usersâ€™ self-awareness and help them structure their trading activity in a way that fits seamlessly into their lifestyle.

Define your Audience

Who is using my application

-People who are already trading and looking to improve, and those who may want to get into trading.

Outline the content of the application

What do I want on each page? (text / pics / images / navigation)

I would like it to someone be like slides with questions. Asking them different questions about their day-to-day life and what they would need or want from trading to best suite theircurrent lifestyle. I would like my page logo/image to be in the background with these questions on a translucent box in front of them.

What do I want the functionality of each page to be?

It would be a Q/A

What is the purpose of my application?

To help Traders build a solid plan and schedule to improve their performance in the market, establishing key times in the market and styles of trading for them.

What business problem or real world problem am I going to be solving?

It is said over 95% of traders fail in their attempts to become profitable. Through my experience this comes from a lack of discipline and structure. I would like to help change those numbers by providing insight that most do not have when they are first starting out or struggling to progress due to a lack of knowledge or experience.

Define the attributes of your website

Color Palette

Black, Grey, White

Images

I have an image I've found online that is a simple trading logo that i would like to use that will be in the background of at all times.

Fonts

Nothing distracting, strictly professional.

Logos

The logo would be the same as the image.

Navigation

I want it to start with a quote, regarding the failure of traders, to inspire, then you will see the logo, and a box to begin. As you answer the questions, it will proceed to the next until the end when a final slide will produce the best plan for them.
