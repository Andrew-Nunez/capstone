      <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Why was LIQID created?</p>
        <p>Research shows a large majority of traders, particularly day traders, fail and quit within a relatively short period. This failure is directly related to the lack of success most will experience as further research shows that a staggering 95% of people will lose money and never reach profitability regardless of the amount of time spent in the market...</p>
        <p>Studies suggest that 80% of day traders quit within the first two years, and nearly 40% within the first month. After three years, only about 13% remain, and after five years, only 7%.</p>
        <p> As someone who can relate with this statistic through my 3 1/2 years I can say i have both, lost money and thought about giving up many times. It was only after i received proper mentorship that i had my breakthrough.</p>
        <p>Yes, there is a very dark reality that most struggle to face, and i find a majority of people starting out are unaware of.</p>
        <p>But what i have found to be the common denominator in all of this is simply a lack of knowledge. Most do not realize that we are competing against some of the greatest minds in human history. unfortunately the will and desire to succeed is simply not enough. </p>
        <p>Here at LIQID i'd like to break those barriers, and provide crucial advice & resources that will improve a traders chance of doing what is described as nearly impossible, astronomically.</p>
        <p>Are you ready to beat the odds...?</p>
